This project has been done with the help of the Blent.AI team, thanks to the dataset kindly provided by Datagram.

The purpose is to predict the Air Bnb price based on features scrapped from the Air Bnb website, and use the prediction for other commercial purposes.

Note that in order to preserve the intellectual property of the project, we won't be sharing the original dataset, nor will we be sharing the original code source. The code here presented is a modified/simplified version of the original, entirely realized by myself.

Many thanks again for Blent.AI and Datagram team for providing the opportunity to participate to such an interesting project.
